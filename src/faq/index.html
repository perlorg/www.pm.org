<h2>
    General Questions
</h2>
<h3>
    <a href="#what">*</a><a name="what"></a>
    What is Perl Mongers?
</h3>
<p>
    Perl Mongers is a loose association of international Perl User Groups.
    Individual groups vary a great deal in the details of what they actually
    do, but in most cases they are groups of Perl users in a particular
    location who get together periodically to discuss Perl and related topics.
</p>
<p>
    Perl Mongers is also the name of the organisation that oversees and
    co-ordinates the local groups. It also provides internet services to these
    groups. Perl Mongers was originally set up as a not-for-profit organisation
    in the state of New York, but in July 2001 it joined with Yet Another
    Society.

<h3>
    <a href="#area">*</a><a name="area"></a>
    Is there a Perl Mongers group in my area?
</h3>
<p>
    The list of currently established groups is [% link_to('/groups/', 'here')
    %]
</p>
<h3>
    <a href="#start">*</a><a name="start"></a>
    How do I start a Perl Mongers group?
</h3>
<p>
    Simply find some Perl hackers in your area and ask them if they'd be
    interested in starting a group.
</p>
<p>
    Experience shows that having a mailing list and a web site help to drum up
    interest in your new group. Almost certainly you'll already have access to
    servers to set them up on, but if you need help with that, we will gladly
    supply both web space and a mailing list.
</p>
<p>
    The only other thing to do is to [% link_to('/start/', 'let us know') %]
    about your new group so that we can add you to the list of established
    groups.
</p>
<h3>
    <a href="#support">*</a><a name="support"></a>
    What support exists for group leaders?
</h3>
<p>
    All group leaders are added to the <a href=
    "http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/pm_groups">group leaders mailing list</a>.
    The #mongers channel on <a href="http://irc.perl.org/">irc.perl.org</a>
    exists for leaders to discuss anything related to running a group.

    Internet Services

    <a href="#services">*</a><a name="services"></a>
    What Internet services can Perl Mongers provide?
</h3>
<p>
    See [% link_to('/faq/hosting_faq.html', 'Group Hosting FAQ') %]
</p>
<h3>
    <a href="#slow">*</a><a name="slow"></a>
    Why does it sometimes take awhile to get Perl Mongers services set up for
    my group?
</h3>
<p>
    Perl Mongers is an all volunteer organization, and almost all of our system
    administrators have very demanding commitments outside of Perl Mongers. We
    do things as quickly as is reasonable considering all of our other
    commitments. Additionally, there's nothing stopping you from operating your
    group while you are waiting for your Perl Mongers services.

    Perl Mongers logo
</h2>
<p>
    The camel used in association with the Perl language is a trademark of O'Reilly &amp; Associates. 
    More information: 
    <a href="http://onlamp.com/pub/a/oreilly/perl/usage/">[1]</a> 
    <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/3157">[2]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Perl Mongers groups can use the logo that appears on this page on their own
    web page as long as they include the following text somewhere (able to be
    clearly seen) on the page:
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The use of the camel image in association with the Perl language is a
    trademark of O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc. Used with permission."
</p>
<p>
    Use of the Perl Mongers logo in other media is evaluated on a case by case
    basis since Perl Mongers is legally liable for its misuse. Our license with
    O'Reilly &amp; Associates requires us to report misuse of the Camel logo
    with the Perl Mongers name. Help us not get in trouble.
    You can only use the image as you find it. You cannot
    incorporate it into a larger logo or make it look like it is part of a
    larger graphic.
